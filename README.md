# Binary Decision Diagram   
This is an attempt to create a Binary Decision Diagram.

## Goals
a) **Learn** about binary decision diagrams and related algorithms

b) Create an efficient data structure taking advantage of modern CPU architecture

c) Desire to scale well as the number of variables becomes large

d) Beat CUDD

## Implementation Details
This first implementation is based off of the paper from Pham and Emerson. It can be found in *resources/papers/yabdd.pdf*
